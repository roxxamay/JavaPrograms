### Code Explanation

#### Code Before Explanation

```java
/**
 * Write a method named getEvenDigitSum with one parameter of type int called number.
 *
 * The method should return the sum of the even digits within the number.
 *
 * If the number is negative, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
 *
 * EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
 *
 * * getEvenDigitSum(123456789); → should return 20 since 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20
 *
 * * getEvenDigitSum(252); → should return 4 since 2 + 2 = 4
 *
 * * getEvenDigitSum(-22); → should return -1 since the number is negative
 *
 * NOTE: The method getEvenDigitSum should be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
 *
 * NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.
 *  */

    public static int getEvenDigitSum(int number) {

            int sum = 0;
            while (number > 0) {
                if (number % 2 == 0) {
                    sum =sum + ( number % 10);
                }
                number = number / 10;
            }

    }
}

#### Explanation

1. **Class Declaration (`public class EvenDigitSum`)**: Defines a public class named `EvenDigitSum`. In Java, every application must contain a main class that wraps up all the code. However, this class is not the entry point but demonstrates how to use the `getEvenDigitSum` method.

2. **Method Declaration (`public static int getEvenDigitSum(int number)`)**: Declares a public static method named `getEvenDigitSum` that takes an integer parameter `number` and returns an integer. Static methods belong to the class rather than instances of the class.

3. **Conditional Statement (`if (number < 0)`)**: Checks if the input number is less than zero. If true, it prints "Invalid Value" and returns `-1`.

4. **Variable Initialization (`int sum = 0`)**: Initializes a variable `sum` to store the sum of even digits. It's set to `0` initially because no digits have been processed yet.

5. **While Loop**: Continues as long as `number` is greater than `0`. Inside the loop:

   -  **If Statement (`if (number % 2 == 0)`)**: Checks if the last digit of `number` is even. If true, adds the digit to `sum`.
   -  **Modulo Operation (`number % 10`)**: Extracts the last digit of `number`.
   -  **Division Assignment Operator (`number = number / 10`)**: Removes the last digit from `number`.

6. **Print Statement (`System.out.println("sum : " + sum)`)**: Prints the final sum of even digits.

7. **Return Statement (`return sum`)**: Returns the sum of even digits.

#### Dry Run

Let's perform a dry run of the `getEvenDigitSum` method with the input `123456`.

-  Initial `number` is `123456`.
-  Since `number` is positive, proceed without printing "Invalid Value".
-  Initialize `sum` to `0`.
-  Enter the while loop. `number` is still `123456`.
   -  Last digit is `6`, which is even. Add `6` to `sum` (now `6`).
   -  Remove the last digit from `number`, making it `12345`.
-  Repeat the process:
   -  Last digit is `5`, odd. Skip adding to `sum`.
   -  `number` becomes `1234`.
   -  Last digit is `4`, even. Add `4` to `sum` (now `10`).
   -  `number` becomes `123`.
   -  Last digit is `3`, odd. Skip adding to `sum`.
   -  `number` becomes `12`.
   -  Last digit is `2`, even. Add `2` to `sum` (now `12`).
   -  `number` becomes `1`.
   -  Last digit is `1`, odd. Skip adding to `sum`.
   -  `number` becomes `0`.
-  Exit the loop.
-  Print `sum` (which is now `12`) and return `12`.

#### Additional Context

This code demonstrates several key Java concepts:

-  **Methods**: How to define and call methods.
-  **Control Flow**: Use of conditional statements (`if`) and loops (`while`).
-  **Arithmetic Operations**: Modulo operation (`%`) for checking divisibility and division assignment operator (`/`) for removing digits.
-  **Data Types**: Integer (`int`) for storing numerical values.
-  **Printing**: Using `System.out.println` for output.

Understanding these concepts is fundamental to mastering Java programming.
