### Code Explanation

#### Code Before Explanation

```java
/**
 * Question: Implementing Equal Sum Checker
 * Objective:
 * Create a Java class named EqualSumChecker that checks whether two arrays have equal sums. The class should provide a static method named hasEqualSums(int[] array1, int[] array2) that takes two integer arrays as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of elements in both arrays is equal.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * The method should handle cases where one or both arrays are empty. In such cases, it should return true.
 * Ensure that the method works correctly even when the arrays contain negative numbers.
 * Write unit tests to verify the correctness of your implementation against the following test cases:
 * Two empty arrays should return true.
 * An array with all zeros and another array with any non-zero values should return true.
 * Arrays with different sums should return false.
 * Arrays with the same sum but different orders of elements should return true.
 * Example:
 * Given the following inputs:
 *
 * array1 = {1, 2, 3} and array2 = {3, 2, 1}
 * array1 = {} and array2 = {}
 * The method should return true for both cases since the sums of elements in both arrays are equal.
 *
 * Notes:
 * Your solution should not modify the input arrays.
 * Consider edge cases and ensure your method handles them gracefully.

#### Explanation

1. **Class Declaration (`public class EqualSumChecker`)**: Defines a public class named `EqualSumChecker`. A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances of the class). The `public` keyword means this class can be accessed from anywhere.

2. **Main Method (`public static void main(String[] args)`)**: The entry point for any Java application. When the JVM starts, it calls the main method. The `public` keyword means this method can be called from anywhere. `static` means it belongs to the `EqualSumChecker` class itself, not to any instance of the class. `void` indicates that this method doesn't return anything.

3. **Array Initialization (`int[] arrOne = { 1,3,3, 2, 3 }; int[] arrTwo = { 3, 2, 1 };`)**: Declares and initializes two integer arrays. `int[]` specifies the type of the array, and `{}` contains the elements of the array.

4. **Method Call (`hasEqualSums(arrOne, arrTwo);`)**: Calls the `hasEqualSums` method, passing `arrOne` and `arrTwo` as arguments.

5. **Method Declaration (`public static void hasEqualSums(int[] arrOne, int[] arrTwo)`)**: Declares a public static method named `hasEqualSums` that takes two integer arrays as parameters. `public` allows this method to be accessible from anywhere. `static` means it belongs to the class rather than instances of the class. `void` indicates that this method doesn't return a value.

6. **Variable Initialization (`int sumArrOne = 0; int sumArrTwo = 0;`)**: Initializes two integer variables to store the sum of elements in the two arrays.

7. **For Loops**: Iterates through each element in the arrays to calculate the sum of their elements. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches the length of the array minus 1.

8. **If Statement**: Compares the sums of the two arrays. If they are equal, it prints "array one is equal to array two". Otherwise, it prints "array one is not equal to array two".

#### Dry Run

Let's perform a dry run of the code with the given example arrays:

-  **Before Execution**: `arrOne = [1, 3, 3, 2, 3]`, `arrTwo = [3, 2, 1]`.

-  **Inside `hasEqualSums` Method**:

   -  Initialize `sumArrOne = 0`.
   -  Loop through `arrOne`: `sumArrOne += 1 -> 1`, `sumArrOne += 3 -> 4`, `sumArrOne += 3 -> 7`, `sumArrOne += 2 -> 9`, `sumArrOne += 3 -> 12`.
   -  Initialize `sumArrTwo = 0`.
   -  Loop through `arrTwo`: `sumArrTwo += 3 -> 3`, `sumArrTwo += 2 -> 5`, `sumArrTwo += 1 -> 6`.

-  **After Calculation**:

   -  `sumArrOne = 12`.
   -  `sumArrTwo = 6`.

-  **Comparison**: Since `12 != 6`, the condition fails, and the program prints "array one is not equal to array two".

#### Additional Context

This code demonstrates how to compare the sums of two arrays in Java. It's a fundamental concept in programming, especially useful in scenarios where you need to determine if two sets of data have equivalent totals. Understanding loops, conditional statements, and method declarations is crucial for solving similar problems.
