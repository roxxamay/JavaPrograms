### Code Explanation

```java
/**
 * Create a for statement using a range of numbers from 1 to 1000 inclusive.
 * 
 * Sum all the numbers that can be divided with both 3 and also with 5.
 * 
 * For those numbers that met the above conditions, print out the number.
 * 
 * Break out of the loop once you find 5 numbers that met the above conditions.
 * 
 * After breaking out of the loop print the sum of the numbers that met the above conditions.
 * 
 * Note: Type all code in main method 
 *

public class SumThreeAndFive {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
                sum = sum + i;
            }
        }

### Explanation

#### Comments as Questions and Answers

1. **What is the purpose of the program?**
   - The program aims to calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 and 1000 that are divisible by both 3 and 5.

2. **How does it achieve this goal?**
   - By iterating through each number in the specified range and checking if it meets the divisibility criteria. If so, it adds the number to a running total (`sum`). Once five such numbers have been found, the loop should theoretically stop, but the code does not implement this logic.

3. **Why use a `for` loop instead of another loop structure?**
   - A `for` loop is chosen because it allows for easy initialization (`int i = 0`), condition checking (`i < 1000`), and incrementing (`i++`) within a single statement, making the loop setup concise and readable.

4. **What does `if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0)` check?**
   - This condition checks if the current number (`i`) is divisible by both 3 and 5. The `%` operator returns the remainder of the division, so if `i % 3 == 0` means `i` is divisible by 3 without a remainder, and similarly for 5.

5. **Why add `i` to `sum` only when the condition is true?**
   - To accumulate the sum of all numbers that meet the divisibility criteria. Each time such a number is found, it is added to the `sum`.

6. **What happens after the loop completes?**
   - The program prints the final value of `sum`, which represents the sum of all numbers between 1 and 1000 that are divisible by both 3 and 5.

#### Line-by-Line Explanation

- **Line 1-13**: Class and method declaration. The class `SumThreeAndFive` contains the `main` method where the program starts execution.
- **Line 18**: Initializes `sum` to 0. This variable will hold the cumulative sum of numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
- **Line 19-22**: Iterates from 0 to 999. For each iteration, it checks if the current number `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5. If so, it adds `i` to `sum`.
- **Line 24**: Prints the final value of `sum`, which is the sum of all numbers between 1 and 1000 that are divisible by both 3 and 5.

#### Dry Run

Given the current implementation, the program does not actually break out of the loop after finding 5 numbers that meet the criteria. However, assuming we modify the program to include this functionality, here's how it would work:

1. Initialize `sum` to 0.
2. Start the loop with `i = 0`. Since no number less than 1 is divisible by both 3 and 5, `sum` remains 0.
3. Increment `i` to 1. Again, no match, so `sum` is still 0.
4. Continue this pattern until `i = 333`, which is the first number divisible by both 3 and 5. Add `333` to `sum`, making `sum = 333`.
5. Repeat the process, adding `666` to `sum`, making `sum = 999`.
6. At `i = 999`, add `999` to `sum`, making `sum = 1998`.
7. Now, let's assume the modified program breaks out of the loop after finding 5 such numbers. In reality, the original code does not implement this logic, so it continues to add every number divisible by both 3 and 5 until `i = 1000`.

#### Additional Context

This program demonstrates basic looping constructs, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations in Java. It's a straightforward example of how to iterate over a range of numbers, apply a condition to filter results, and accumulate a sum. For beginners, it's essential to understand the role of each part of the code, especially the loop and conditional statements, as they form the basis for many algorithms and problem-solving approaches in programming.
