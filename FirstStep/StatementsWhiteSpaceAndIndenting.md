#### Explanation

##### Keywords and Concepts Used

- **class**: A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
- **public**: An access modifier that means this class is accessible everywhere.
- **static**: A keyword indicating that the method belongs to the `StatementsWhiteSpaceAndIndenting` class itself rather than to any instance of the class.
- **void**: Indicates that the method does not return any value.
- **main**: The entry point for any Java application. When the program starts, the JVM calls the `main` method.
- **String[] args**: An array of `String` type that holds command-line arguments passed to the program.
- **int**: A primitive data type that stores integer values.
- **var**: A variable declaration without specifying its type. The compiler determines the type based on the initializer.
- **++** and **--**: Increment and decrement operators, respectively, used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by one.
- **println**: A method that prints the argument passed to it followed by a newline.
- **+**: The string concatenation operator, used to combine two strings into one.

##### Comments as Questions and Answers

1. **What is a statement?**
   - A statement is a single unit of execution in a program. It can be an assignment, a control flow statement (like `if`, `for`, `while`), or an expression evaluation. In the code, `int myVar = 50;` is a statement because it declares and initializes a variable.

2. **What is whitespace?**
   - Whitespace refers to characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines that do not affect the meaning of the program but are used for readability and formatting. In the code, the space between `myVar` and `= 50` is considered whitespace.

3. **What is indentation?**
   - Indentation refers to the practice of aligning code elements in a consistent manner to improve readability. It does not affect the execution of the program. In the code, the use of spaces at the beginning of lines after `{` helps visually group related statements together.

##### Line-by-Line Explanation

- Lines 6-8 declare and initialize an integer variable `myVar` with the value `50`. This is a statement.
- Lines 10-12 increment (`++`) and then decrement (`--`) the value of `myVar`.
- Line 13 prints the string `"this is test"` to the console.
- Lines 15-17 demonstrate string concatenation using the `+` operator to print a multi-part string.
- Line 19 declares another integer variable `anotherVar`, decrements its value, and then prints a string. The use of semicolons separates declarations and operations, which is good practice for clarity.

##### Dry Run

1. `int myVar = 50;` - Declare and initialize `myVar` with `50`.
2. `myVar++;` - Increment `myVar` by 1, making it `51`.
3. `myVar--;` - Decrement `myVar` by 1, making it `50` again.
4. `System.out.println("this is test");` - Print `"this is test"` to the console.
5. `System.out.println("this is "+ "another"+ "still more...");` - Concatenate and print `"this is another still more..."` to the console.
6. `int anotherVar = 50; anotherVar--; System.out.println("this is another one");` - Declare `anotherVar`, decrement it, and print `"this is another one"` to the console.

##### Additional Context

This code snippet is designed to introduce basic concepts such as variable declaration, initialization, arithmetic operations, and printing to the console. It also touches upon the importance of whitespace and indentation for code readability.
