### Code Explanation

#### Code Before Explanation

```java
/**
 * Write a method isLeapYear with a parameter of type int named year.
 * The parameter needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 9999.
 * If the parameter is not in that range return false.
 * Otherwise, if it is in the valid range, calculate if the year is a leap year and return true if it is, otherwise return false.
 * A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is divisible by 400.
 *
 * Examples of input/output:
 *
 * * isLeapYear(-1600); →  should return false since the parameter is not in the range (1-9999)
 *
 * * isLeapYear(1600); → should return true since 1600 is a leap year
 *
 * * isLeapYear(2017); → should return false since 2017 is not a leap year
 *
 * * isLeapYear(2000); → should return true because 2000 is a leap year
 *
 * NOTE:  The solution to the Leap Year coding exercise earlier in the course created the isLeapYear method. You can use that solution if you wish.
 *
 * Write another method getDaysInMonth with two parameters month and year.  ​Both of type int.
 *
 * If parameter month is < 1 or > 12 return -1. ​
 * If parameter year is < 1 or > 9999 then return -1.
 *
 * This method needs to return the number of days in the month. Be careful about leap years they have 29 days in month 2 (February).
 *
 * You should check if the year is a leap year using the method isLeapYear described above.
 *
 * Examples of input/output:
 *
 * * getDaysInMonth(1, 2020); → should return 31 since January has 31 days.
 *
 * * getDaysInMonth(2, 2020); → should return 29 since February has 29 days in a leap year and 2020 is a leap year.
 *
 * * getDaysInMonth(2, 2018); → should return 28 since February has 28 days if it's not a leap year and 2018 is not a leap year.
 *
 * * getDaysInMonth(-1, 2020); → should return -1 since the parameter month is invalid.
 *
 * * getDaysInMonth(1, -2020); → should return -1 since the parameter year is outside the range of 1 to 9999.
 *
 * HINT: Use the switch statement.
 *
 * NOTE: Methods isLeapYear and getDaysInMonth need to be public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
 *
 * NOTE: Do not add a main method to solution code.

#### Explanation

##### Comments as Questions and Answers

1. **What is the purpose of the `isLeap` method?**

   -  The `isLeap` method determines whether a given year is a leap year according to the rules defined in the comment block. A leap year is one that is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

2. **How does the `getDaysInMonth` method work?**

   -  The `getDaysInMonth` method calculates and prints the number of days in a specified month of a given year. It uses the `switch` statement to handle different months and checks if the year is a leap year to determine the number of days in February.

3. **Why is the `isLeap` method necessary for `getDaysInMonth`?**

   -  The `isLeap` method is necessary for `getDaysInMonth` because it helps determine if February should have 28 or 29 days, which depends on whether the year is a leap year.

4. **What is the significance of the `switch` statement in `getDaysInMonth`?**

   -  The `switch` statement in `getDaysInMonth` allows the method to handle different months efficiently by executing different code blocks depending on the value of the `months` parameter.

5. **Why do we need to check if the year is within the valid range in both methods?**
   -  Checking if the year is within the valid range ensures that the methods behave correctly and avoid potential errors or unexpected results when given invalid inputs.

##### Line-by-Line Explanation

-  **Lines 1-51**: These lines contain a multi-line comment that describes the requirements for the `isLeapYear` and `getDaysInMonth` methods. It explains the logic for determining leap years and how to calculate the number of days in a month, including special considerations for leap years.

-  **Line 53**: Declares the class `NumberOfDaysInMonths`.

-  **Lines 54-61**: The `main` method calls `getDaysInMonth` with various arguments to demonstrate its functionality.

-  **Lines 63-69**: Defines the `isLeap` method, which takes an integer `year` as a parameter and returns a boolean indicating whether the year is a leap year.

-  **Lines 72-118**: Defines the `getDaysInMonth` method, which takes two integers `months` and `years` as parameters. It uses a `switch` statement to print the number of days in the specified month of the given year, taking into account whether the year is a leap year for February.

##### Dry Run

Given the nature of the code, a dry run involves calling the `getDaysInMonth` method with specific arguments and observing the output. Since the `isLeap` method is called internally by `getDaysInMonth`, we'll focus on the latter.

-  **Call**: `getDaysInMonth(1, 2020)`

   -  Output: "January has 31 days"
   -  Explanation: January always has 31 days, so the `switch` statement matches the case for `1` and executes the corresponding code block.

-  **Call**: `getDaysInMonth(2, 2020)`

   -  Output: "February has 29 days"
   -  Explanation: The `isLeap` method is called with `2020` as the argument, which is a leap year, so the method returns `true`. Consequently, the `getDaysInMonth` method outputs "February has 29 days".

-  **Call**: `getDaysInMonth(2, 2018)`
   -  Output: "February has 28 days"
   -  Explanation: The `isLeap` method is called with `2018` as the argument, which is not a leap year, so the method returns `false`. As a result, the `getDaysInMonth` method outputs "February has 28 days".

##### Additional Context

This code demonstrates the application of conditional logic (`if` statements), method calls, and the `switch` statement in Java. It also highlights the importance of validating input parameters to ensure correct program behavior. Understanding these concepts is crucial for beginners learning Java, as they form the basis for more complex problem-solving in later stages of learning.
