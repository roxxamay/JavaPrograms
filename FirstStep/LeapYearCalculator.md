/**
 * Question: Implement a Leap Year Calculator in Java
 * Objective:
 * Create a Java application named LeapYearCalculator that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400. However, years that are only divisible by 100 are not leap years, unless they are also divisible by 400.
 * 
 * For example, the year 2000 was a leap year because it is divisible by both 4 and 400. The year 1900 was not a leap year even though it is divisible by 4, because it is not divisible by 400.
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * User Input: Your program should prompt the user to enter a year.
 * Leap Year Calculation: Based on the input year, calculate whether it is a leap year or not according to the rules mentioned above.
 * Output: Display the result to the user indicating whether the entered year is a leap year or not.
 * Example:
 * If the user enters 2020, the program should output: Yes, 2020 is a leap year.
 * 
 * If the user enters 2021, the program should output: No, 2021 is not a leap year.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * Ensure your program handles invalid inputs gracefully, such as non-numeric characters or negative numbers.
 * Use appropriate comments throughout your code to explain the logic and any assumptions made

#### Explanation

##### Comments as Questions and Answers
- **Question:** What is a leap year?
- **Answer:** A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400. This rule ensures that the calendar year stays aligned with the Earth's revolutions around the Sun.

- **Question:** How do we determine if a year is a leap year?
- **Answer:** By checking if the year is divisible by 4, then not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

##### Line-by-Line Explanation

- **Line 1-20:** This is a multi-line comment (also known as a block comment). It provides detailed instructions and requirements for implementing a leap year calculator in Java. It explains the objective, requirements, examples, and notes about handling invalid inputs.

- **Lines 22-23:** The `public class LeapYearCalculator` declaration defines a new class named `LeapYearCalculator`. In Java, everything is part of a class, and classes are the fundamental building blocks of Java applications.

- **Line 23:** Inside the `LeapYearCalculator` class, there's a `main` method. This is the entry point of every Java application. When you run a Java program, the JVM starts executing the code from the `main` method.

- **Lines 24-36:** These lines call the `isLeap` method with various integer arguments representing years. The purpose of these calls is to test the leap year calculation logic implemented in the `isLeap` method.

- **Line 40:** The `isLeap` method is declared as `public static void`, meaning it can be called without creating an instance of the `LeapYearCalculator` class, and it does not return any value (`void`).

- **Line 42:** This line checks if the year is a leap year using the leap year rules. It uses the modulus operator `%` to check divisibility. The expression `year % 400 == 0 || year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0` checks if the year is divisible by 400 or if it's divisible by 4 but not by 100, adhering to the leap year rules.

- **Lines 43-47:** Depending on the condition checked in line 42, this block prints out whether the year is a leap year or not.

##### Dry Run

Let's perform a dry run of the code with one of the test cases, `isLeap(2000);`.

1. The `isLeap` method is called with the argument `2000`.
2. The condition `year % 400 == 0 || year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0` is evaluated.
   - Since `2000` is divisible by both 4 and 400, the condition evaluates to true.
3. The program prints `"2000 is a leap year"`.

##### Additional Context

This code demonstrates how to implement a simple utility function in Java that performs a specific calculation (determining if a year is a leap year) and how to use conditional statements to execute different blocks of code based on conditions. It's a good example of basic Java syntax, including method declarations, conditional statements, and printing to the console.
