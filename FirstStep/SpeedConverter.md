#### Code Snippet

```java

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        toMilesPerHour(40);
        System.out.println("milesPerHour : " + toMilesPerHour(1.5));

        printConversion(123);
        printConversion(10.5);
    }

    public static long toMilesPerHour(double kilometersPerHour) {
        if (kilometersPerHour < 0) {
            return -1;
        } else {
            return Math.round(kilometersPerHour / 1.609);
        }
    }

    public static void printConversion(double kilometersPerHour) {
        if (kilometersPerHour < 0 ) {
            System.out.println("invalid value");
        } else {
            long milesPerHour = toMilesPerHour(kilometersPerHour);
            System.out.println(kilometersPerHour + " km/h = " + milesPerHour + " mi/h ");
        }
    }

#### Explanation

##### Comments as Questions and Answers

1. **What is the purpose of the `toMilesPerHour` method?**

   -  The `toMilesPerHour` method is designed to convert a speed measurement from kilometers per hour to miles per hour. It takes a single parameter, `kilometersPerHour`, of type `double`. If the input is negative, it returns `-1` to indicate an invalid value. Otherwise, it calculates the equivalent speed in miles per hour, rounds it to the nearest whole number, and returns it.

2. **How does the `printConversion` method work?**
   -  The `printConversion` method prints the conversion of a given speed from kilometers per hour to miles per hour. It first checks if the input speed is negative. If so, it prints `"invalid value"` to indicate an error. Otherwise, it calls the `toMilesPerHour` method to perform the conversion and then prints the result.

##### Line-by-Line Explanation

-  **Line 1-7**: These lines contain a comment block that describes the requirements for the `toMilesPerHour` method. It specifies the method name, its parameter, the return type, and the conditions under which it should return specific values.

-  **Lines 8-37**: The `SpeedConverter` class definition includes two methods: `main` and `toMilesPerHour`.

   -  **Line 9-15**: The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `toMilesPerHour` and `printConversion` methods. It calls `toMilesPerHour` with a hardcoded value of `40` and another value calculated from `1.5`. Then, it calls `printConversion` twice with hardcoded values of `123` and `10.5`.

   -  **Line 18-27**: The `toMilesPerHour` method implementation. It checks if the input `kilometersPerHour` is less than `0`. If true, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it performs the conversion by dividing `kilometersPerHour` by `1.609` (the conversion factor from km/h to mph), rounds the result to the nearest whole number using `Math.round()`, and returns it.

   -  **Line 29-36**: The `printConversion` method implementation. It checks if the input `kilometersPerHour` is less than `0`. If true, it prints `"invalid value"`. Otherwise, it calls `toMilesPerHour` to get the converted speed in miles per hour and prints the result.

##### Dry Run

Let's perform a dry run of the `main` method to see how the program executes:

1. Call `toMilesPerHour(40)`:

   -  Since `40` is greater than `0`, the method proceeds to calculate `40 / 1.609`, which equals approximately `24.859375`.
   -  Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives `25`.
   -  So, `toMilesPerHour(40)` returns `25`.

2. Print the result of `toMilesPerHour(1.5)`:

   -  Calculate `1.5 / 1.609`, which equals approximately `0.932974`.
   -  Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives `1`.
   -  Therefore, `toMilesPerHour(1.5)` returns `1`.
   -  The string `"milesPerHour : "` concatenated with the result `1` is printed.

3. Call `printConversion(123)`:

   -  Since `123` is greater than `0`, the method proceeds similarly to the first call.
   -  The calculation `123 / 1.609` equals approximately `76.487`.
   -  Rounding this to the nearest whole number gives `77`.
   -  Thus, `printConversion(123)` prints `"123 km/h = 77 mi/h"`.

4. Call `printConversion(10.5)`:
   -  Similar calculations lead to `printConversion(10.5)` printing `"10.5 km/h = 6 mi/h"`.

This dry run illustrates how the program converts speeds between kilometers per hour and miles per hour, handling both valid and invalid inputs.
