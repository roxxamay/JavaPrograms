#### File: `FirstAndLastDigitSum.java`

```java
/**
 * Write a method named sumFirstAndLastDigit with one parameter of type int called number.
 * The method needs to find the first and the last digit of the parameter number passed to the method, using a loop and return the sum of the first and the last digit of that number.
 * If the number is negative then the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.

### Explanation

#### Comments as Questions and Answers

1. **What is the purpose of the `FirstAndLastDigitSum` class?**

   -  The `FirstAndLastDigitSum` class is designed to contain a method named `sumFirstAndLastDigit` that calculates the sum of the first and last digits of a given integer. If the integer is negative, it returns `-1`.

2. **What does the `main` method do?**

   -  The `main` method calls the `sumFirstAndLastDigit` method with various test inputs to demonstrate its functionality.

3. **How does the `sumFirstAndLastDigit` method work?**
   -  The method checks if the input number is negative. If so, it prints "invalid number" and returns `-1`.
   -  If the number is non-negative, it calculates the sum of the first and last digits of the number.

#### Line-by-Line Explanation

-  **Lines 1-24**: A multi-line comment (also known as a Javadoc comment) that describes the purpose of the `sumFirstAndLastDigit` method. It explains the expected behavior of the method based on different inputs.

-  **Line 26**: Defines the class `FirstAndLastDigitSum`. In Java, everything must be part of a class.

-  **Lines 27-33**: The `main` method where the program starts executing. It calls the `sumFirstAndLastDigit` method with several test cases.

-  **Line 35**: Declares the `sumFirstAndLastDigit` method within the `FirstAndLastDigitSum` class. It takes an integer parameter named `number`.

-  **Lines 36-38**: Checks if the input number is less than zero. If true, it prints "invalid number" and returns `-1`.

-  **Lines 39-46**: If the number is not negative, it proceeds to calculate the sum of the first and last digits. It first finds the last digit (`number % 10`) and stores it in `sum`. Then, it enters a loop that continues until `number` becomes less than 10, effectively removing all but the last digit from `number`. Finally, it adds the remaining `number` (which now holds the first digit) to `sum` and returns the result.

#### Dry Run

Let's perform a dry run of the `sumFirstAndLastDigit` method with the input `12345`.

1. **Input**: `12345`
   -  Check if the number is negative: False
   -  Calculate the last digit: `12345 % 10 = 5` -> Store `5` in `sum`
   -  Enter the loop: `12345 / 10 = 1234`
   -  Repeat the loop until `number < 10`: `1234 / 10 = 123`, `123 / 10 = 12`, `12 / 10 = 1`
   -  Now, `number` is `1`, which is less than `10`, exit the loop.
   -  Add the first and last digits: `1 + 5 = 6`
   -  Return `6`

#### Additional Context

This code demonstrates basic concepts such as methods, parameters, conditional statements (`if-else`), arithmetic operations, loops (`while`), and printing to the console (`System.out.println`). Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for mastering Java programming.
