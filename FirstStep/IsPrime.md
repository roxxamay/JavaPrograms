    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(isPrime(321));
        System.out.println(isPrime(121));
        System.out.println(isPrime(2));

        System.out.println(isPrime(7));
        System.out.println(isPrime(3211));
        System.out.println(isPrime((int) (Math.random())));

        for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            System.out.println(isPrime((int) (Math.random())));
        }

        System.out.println(">>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>");

                System.out.println("Number " + i + " is a prime number");
            }
        }

        System.out.println(">>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>");
    }

    public static boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i <= n / 2; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {

#### Explanation

##### Keywords and Concepts

-  **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (specific instances of the class). In this case, `IsPrime` is a class.
-  **Method**: A block of code designed to perform a specific task and can be called upon by other methods or classes. `main` and `isPrime` are methods.
-  **Static**: A keyword indicating that a method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class. Only one copy of a static method exists in memory.
-  **Public**: An access modifier that allows the method to be accessed from anywhere, not just within the class.
-  **Boolean**: A primitive data type that can hold either `true` or `false`.
-  **For loop**: A control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given condition.
-  **If statement**: A decision-making construct that executes a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to `true`.

##### Comments as Questions and Answers

-  **Q:** What does `System.out.println()` do?

   -  **A:** Prints the argument passed to it followed by a newline to the console.

-  **Q:** What is the purpose of casting `(int)` around `Math.random()`?
   -  **A:** `Math.random()` returns a double value between 0.0 and 1.0. Casting it to an integer truncates the decimal part, effectively generating a random integer between 0 and 1.

##### Line-by-Line Explanation

-  Lines 1-3: Define the class `IsPrime` and its `main` method, where the program starts executing.
-  Lines 4-13: Call the `isPrime` method with various integers to test if they are prime. The results are printed to the console.
-  Lines 15-17: Use a for loop to generate 20 random integers and check if they are prime, printing the results.
-  Lines 19-20: Print a separator line in the console.
-  Lines 21-25: Iterate through numbers 0 to 99, checking each if it's prime, and print those that are.
-  Lines 27-28: Print another separator line.
-  Lines 30-42: Define the `isPrime` method, which checks if a given integer is prime by iterating from 2 to half of the number and checking for divisibility. If no divisor is found, the number is prime.

##### Dry Run

Given the nature of the code, a dry run involves manually going through the steps of the program, especially focusing on how the `isPrime` method works. However, due to the randomness involved in generating numbers and the large number of iterations, a detailed step-by-step execution isn't feasible here. Instead, the key points to observe during a dry run would be:

-  Observing how the `isPrime` method iterates and checks for divisors.
-  Noticing the pattern of prime numbers being correctly identified and non-prime numbers being rejected.
-  Understanding how the use of `Math.random()` affects the outcomes of the tests.

##### Additional Context

This Java program demonstrates the concept of prime numbers and how to determine if a number is prime programmatically. Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The `isPrime` method uses a common algorithm for primality testing, which is efficient for small numbers but can become slow for very large numbers. This program also showcases the use of loops and conditional statements in Java, essential constructs for controlling program flow and logic.
