### Code Explanation

#### Code Snippet
```java
public class EqualtyPrinter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printEqual(21, 12, 21);
        printEqual(-1, 21, 12);
        printEqual(15, 45, 13);
        printEqual(12, 12, 12);
    }

    public static void printEqual(double one, double two, double three) {
        if (one < 0 || two < 0 || three < 0) {
            System.out.println("Invalid Value");
        } else if (one == two && two == three) {
            System.out.println("All numbers are equal");
        } else {
            System.out.println("All numbers are different");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation

##### Comments as Questions and Answers

1. **What is the purpose of the `printEqual` method?**
   - The `printEqual` method is designed to compare three numbers and print out a specific message based on whether the numbers are all equal, all different, or if any number is less than zero.

2. **Why does the method signature use `double` instead of `int`?**
   - The method signature uses `double` because it was initially written to handle floating-point numbers. However, based on the examples provided in the comments, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding or mistake in the implementation details. The examples suggest integer comparisons, but the method is set up for doubles.

3. **How does the program determine if the numbers are invalid?**
   - The program checks if any of the numbers (`one`, `two`, `three`) is less than zero. If so, it prints "Invalid Value".

4. **What happens if none of the conditions are met?**
   - If none of the conditions are met (i.e., no number is less than zero and all numbers are not equal), the program defaults to printing "All numbers are different".

##### Line-by-Line Explanation

- **Line 1-2:** A comment block providing instructions for the `printEqual` method.
- **Line 3-34:** An empty space between the comment block and the class definition, likely intended for additional comments or documentation.
- **Line 36:** Class declaration for `EqualtyPrinter`.
- **Line 37:** Main method declaration. This is where the program starts executing.
- **Lines 38-41:** Calls to the `printEqual` method with different sets of numbers to test its functionality.
- **Line 43:** An empty line separating the main method from the `printEqual` method.
- **Line 44:** Declaration of the `printEqual` method with three `double` parameters.
- **Line 45:** An empty line within the method, possibly for readability or future expansion.
- **Line 46:** Checks if any of the numbers is less than zero. If true, prints "Invalid Value".
- **Line 49:** Another empty line within the method.
- **Line 50:** Checks if any two numbers are equal. If true, prints "Neither all are equal or different". This seems to be a mistake in logic based on the comments.
- **Line 52:** Correctly checks if all three numbers are equal. If true, prints "All numbers are equal".
- **Line 54:** If neither of the above conditions is met, prints "All numbers are different".

##### Dry Run

Given the current implementation, let's perform a dry run with the first call to `printEqual(21, 12, 21)`:

1. The method `printEqual` is called with three arguments: 21, 12, and 21.
2. Since none of the numbers are less than zero, the program moves past the initial check.
3. The program then checks if any two numbers are equal. In this case, both 21 and 12 match another number, but the condition incorrectly prints "Neither all are equal or different" due to a logical error.
4. The correct behavior should be to check if all three numbers are equal, which they are not, leading to the incorrect output.

##### Additional Context

- The original intention behind the `printEqual` method seems to be to compare three numbers and print a message based on their equality or inequality. However, the implementation contains a logical error in the order of checks and conditions.
- The method signature uses `double` parameters, which might not align with the expected input of integers based on the example inputs provided in the comments.
- The comments and the code do not fully align, indicating potential confusion or errors in the implementation details.

##### Conclusion

The `EqualtyPrinter` class demonstrates a common scenario where a method's implementation does not perfectly match its intended functionality or the expectations set by its documentation. This discrepancy highlights the importance of carefully reviewing and testing code against specifications to ensure correctness.
