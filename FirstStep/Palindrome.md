### Code Explanation

#### Code Before Explanation

```java
/**
 * Write a method called isPalindrome with one int parameter called number.
 * 
 * The method needs to return a boolean.
 * 
 * It should return true if the number is a palindrome number otherwise it should return false.
 * 
 * Check the tips below for more info about palindromes.
 * 
 * Example Input/Output
 * 
 * isPalindrome(-1221); → should return true
 * 
 * isPalindrome(707); → should return true
 * 
 * isPalindrome(11212); → should return false because reverse is 21211 and that is not equal to 11212.
 * 
 * Tip: What is a Palindrome number?  A palindrome number is a number which when reversed is equal to the original number. For example: 121, 12321, 1001 etc.
 * 
 * Tip: Logic to check a palindrome number
 * 
 * Find the the reverse of the given number. Store it in some variable say reverse. Compare the number with reverse.
 * 
 * If both are the the same then the number is a palindrome otherwise it is not.
 * 
 * Tip: Logic to reverse a number
 * 
 * Declare and initialize another variable to store the reverse of a number, for example reverse = 0.
 * 
 * Extract the last digit of the given number by performing the modulo division (remainder).
 * Store the last digit to some variable say lastDigit = num % 10.
 * Increase the place value of reverse by one.
 * To increase place value multiply the reverse variable by 10 e.g. reverse = reverse * 10.
 * Add lastDigit to reverse.
 * Since the last digit of the number is processed, remove the last digit of num. To remove the last digit divide number by 10.
 * Repeat steps until number is not equal to (or greater than) zero. 
 * 
 * A while loop would be good for this coding exercise.
 * 
 * Tip: Be careful with negative numbers. They can also be palindrome numbers.
 * 
 * Tip: Be careful with reversing a number, you will need a parameter for comparing a reversed number with the starting number (parameter).
 * 
 * NOTE: The method isPalindrome needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing
 *  */

#### Explanation

1. **Class Declaration (`public class Palindrome`)**: Defines a public class named `Palindrome`. In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (methods).

2. **Method Declaration (`public static void main(String[] args)`)**: The `main` method is the entry point for any Java application. It's where the JVM starts executing the program. The `void` keyword indicates that this method doesn't return any value. The `static` keyword means that the method belongs to the `Palindrome` class itself, rather than to instances of the class.

3. **Method Invocation (`isPalindrome(121); isPalindrome(-121); isPalindrome(35465);`)**: These lines call the `isPalindrome` method with different integer arguments. Each call tests whether the passed integer is a palindrome.

4. **Method Declaration (`public static boolean isPalindrome(int number)`)**: Declares a method named `isPalindrome` that takes an integer argument `number` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is a palindrome.

5. **Variable Initialization (`int reverse = 0; int temp = number;`)**: Initializes two integer variables. `reverse` is used to hold the reversed form of the input number, and `temp` holds the temporary copy of the input number to allow modification without affecting the original value.

6. **While Loop (`while (temp != 0)`)**: This loop continues as long as `temp` is not equal to 0. Inside the loop, the last digit of `temp` is extracted, added to `reverse`, and then removed from `temp`.

7. **Modulo Operation (`int digit = temp % 10;`)**: Calculates the remainder of `temp` divided by 10, effectively extracting the last digit of `temp`.

8. **Arithmetic Operations (`reverse = (reverse * 10) + digit; temp /= 10;`)**: Multiplies `reverse` by 10 to shift its digits one place to the left (increasing its place value), adds the extracted digit to it, and then divides `temp` by 10 to remove its last digit.

9. **Comparison and Return Statement (`return number == reverse;`)**: Compares the original number with its reversed form. If they are equal, the method returns `true`, indicating the number is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `false`.

10. **System Output (`System.out.println("isPalindrome : " + (number == reverse));`)**: Prints a message indicating whether the input number is a palindrome based on the comparison result.

#### Dry Run

Let's perform a dry run of the `isPalindrome` method with the input `-121`.

- Initial setup: `number = -121`, `reverse = 0`, `temp = -121`.
- First iteration: `digit = -1`, `reverse = 0*10 + (-1) = -1`, `temp = -12`.
- Second iteration: `digit = 2`, `reverse = -1*10 + 2 = -12`, `temp = -1`.
- Third iteration: `digit = -1`, `reverse = -12*10 + (-1) = -121`, `temp = 0`.
- Fourth iteration: `digit = 0`, `reverse = -121*10 + 0 = -1210`, `temp = 0`.
- At this point, `temp` becomes 0, ending the loop.
- Comparison: `-121 == -1210` evaluates to `false`, so the method returns `false`.

This dry run demonstrates how the method processes the input number to determine if it's a palindrome, considering the sign of the number.
