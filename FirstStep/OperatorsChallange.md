### Code Explanation

```java
public class OperatorsChallange {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double first = 20.00d;
        double second = 80.00d;

        double sum = (first + second) * 100.00;
        System.out.println("the sum is : " + sum);

        int remainder = (int) (sum % 40.00);
        System.out.println("the remainder is : " + remainder);

        boolean isRemZero = (remainder == 0) ? true : false;

        System.out.println("Is remainder Is Zero [ 1 = true , 0 = false ] : " + isRemZero);

        if (isRemZero == true) {
            System.out.println("there is no remainder ............ ! ");
        } else {
            System.out.println("there is some remainders ............. ! ");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Line-by-Line Explanation

- **Line 1-4**: These lines are part of the header comment, indicating the purpose of the code snippet. It's asking to explain and provide the Java operator precedence table.

- **Line 5**: Declares a public class named `OperatorsChallange`. In Java, every application must contain a main class that wraps up all the code.

- **Line 6**: Defines the `main` method where the JVM starts executing the program. It takes an array of strings as arguments (`String[] args`), which can be used to pass command-line arguments to the program.

- **Lines 7-8**: Declare two `double` variables, `first` and `second`, and initialize them with the values `20.00d` and `80.00d` respectively. The `d` suffix denotes that these are double precision floating-point literals.

- **Line 10**: Calculates the sum of `first` and `second`, then multiplies it by `100.00`. The result is stored in the `sum` variable. Note the use of parentheses around `first + second` to ensure correct order of operations according to Java's operator precedence rules.

- **Line 11**: Prints the value of `sum` to the console.

- **Line 12**: Calculates the remainder of `sum` divided by `40.00` after casting `sum` to an integer. The cast `(int)` truncates the decimal part of `sum`. The result is stored in the `remainder` variable.

- **Line 13**: Prints the value of `remainder` to the console.

- **Line 16**: Uses a ternary operator to check if `remainder` equals zero. If true, it assigns `true` to `isRemZero`; otherwise, it assigns `false`.

- **Line 18**: Prints the value of `isRemZero` to the console, indicating whether the remainder was zero.

- **Lines 20-25**: Contains an `if-else` statement that checks the value of `isRemZero`. If `isRemZero` is `true`, it prints "there is no remainder ............ ! "; otherwise, it prints "there is some remainders ............. ! ".

#### Dry Run

Let's perform a dry run of the code to see how it executes:

1. Initialize `first` with `20.00d` and `second` with `80.00d`.
2. Calculate `sum` as `(20.00 + 80.00) * 100.00 = 2000.00`.
3. Print "the sum is : 2000.00".
4. Cast `sum` to `int` (truncating decimals), resulting in `remainder = 2000 % 40 = 0`.
5. Print "the remainder is : 0".
6. Check if `remainder` is zero, assigning `true` to `isRemZero`.
7. Print "Is remainder Is Zero [ 1 = true , 0 = false ] : 1".
8. Since `isRemZero` is `true`, print "there is no remainder ............ ! ".


### Java Operator Precedence Table

In Java, operators are executed in a specific order of precedence, which determines how expressions involving multiple operators are evaluated. Here's a simplified version of the Java operator precedence table:

1. Parentheses `()`
2. Unary operators (e.g., `++`, `--`)
3. Multiplicative operators (`*`, `/`, `%`)
4. Additive operators (`+`, `-`)
5. Relational operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
6. Equality operators (`==`, `!=`)
7. Logical AND (`&&`)
8. Logical OR (`||`)
9. Conditional (ternary) operator (`? :`)

### Explanation

- **Parentheses `()`**: They have the highest precedence and can be used to explicitly specify the order of operations. Any expression enclosed in parentheses is evaluated first.
  
- **Unary operators (`++`, `--`)**: These operators increase or decrease the value of a variable by one. They operate on a single operand.
  
- **Multiplicative operators (`*`, `/`, `%`)**: These operators deal with multiplication, division, and modulus operations. They have higher precedence than additive operators but lower than relational and equality operators.
  
- **Additive operators (`+`, `-`)**: Addition and subtraction have lower precedence than multiplicative operators but higher than relational and equality operators.
  
- **Relational operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)**: These operators compare two values and return a boolean result. They have higher precedence than equality operators.
  
- **Equality operators (`==`, `!=`)**: These operators compare two values for equality or inequality. They have lower precedence than relational operators.
  
- **Logical AND (`&&`)**: This operator returns true if both operands are true. It has higher precedence than logical OR.
  
- **Logical OR (`||`)**: This operator returns true if either or both operands are true. It has lower precedence than logical AND.
  
- **Conditional (ternary) operator (`? :`)**: Also known as the ternary operator, it allows for inline if-then-else statements. It has the lowest precedence among all operators.

Understanding operator precedence is essential for writing correct and efficient Java code, especially when dealing with complex expressions that involve multiple operators.
