### Explanation of Each Keyword and Concept Used

- **public**: This is an access modifier that specifies the visibility of the class. A `public` class can be accessed from anywhere, including outside its package.
- **class**: This keyword is used to declare a class in Java. A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (methods).
- **HelloWorld**: This is the name of the class. By convention, class names start with an uppercase letter.
- **{** and **}**: These curly braces define the body of the class. Everything between them is part of the class definition.
- **public static void main(String[] args)**: This is the method where the program starts. It must be present in every Java application.
    - **public**: Access modifier for the method, meaning it can be called from anywhere.
    - **static**: Indicates that the method belongs to the `HelloWorld` class itself, not to any instance of the class.
    - **void**: Specifies that this method does not return any value.
    - **main**: The entry point for any Java application. When the JVM starts, it looks for the `main` method to begin execution.
    - **String[] args**: An array of strings passed as command-line arguments to the program. In this simple example, no arguments are used.

### Line-by-Line Explanation

```java
1: public class HelloWorld {
```
- Declares a public class named `HelloWorld`.

```java
2:     public static void main(String[] args) {
```
- Defines the `main` method within the `HelloWorld` class. This method is the entry point of the program.

```java
3:         System.out.println("hello World");
```
- Prints the string `"hello World"` to the console. `System.out` is a standard way to print text to the console in Java.

```java
4:     }
```
- Closes the `main` method block.

```java
5: }
```
- Closes the `HelloWorld` class definition.

### Dry Run

1. **Start**: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) starts and loads the `HelloWorld` class.
2. **Load `main` Method**: The JVM locates the `main` method within the `HelloWorld` class.
3. **Execute `main` Method**:
    - The `println` statement is executed, printing `"hello World"` to the console.
4. **End**: The program terminates after the `main` method completes execution.

### Additional Context

This code represents a very basic Java program designed to demonstrate the syntax required to create a standalone executable program. It includes the necessary components to compile and run a Java program, such as a class declaration, a `main` method, and a call to `System.out.println()` to display output to the console. Understanding this code is fundamental for beginners learning Java, as it introduces key concepts like classes, methods, and basic input/output operations.
