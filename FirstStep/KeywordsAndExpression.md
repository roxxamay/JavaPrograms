//what is keyword? explain with 53 keywords example?
//
public class KeywordsAndExpression {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //int
        int intTwo = 5 ;
        //false , true , null 
        double kilometers = ( 100 * 1.609344 ) ;
        System.out.println("Expression : kilometers = ( 100 * 1.609344 ) = " +kilometers);

        int highScore = 50 ;
        if (highScore == 50) {
            System.out.println("expression : highScore == 50 = "+ highScore);
        }

        //int the following find expression
        int score = 100 ;
        if (score > 99 ) {
            System.out.println("You got High score ! ");
            score = 0 ;
            System.out.println("the expression are : score = 100 , score > 99 , score = 0");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation

1. **Class Declaration (`public class KeywordsAndExpression`):** This line declares a public class named `KeywordsAndExpression`. In Java, every application must contain a main class that wraps up all the code. It is the entry point for the program.

2. **Main Method (`public static void main(String[] args)`):** This is the main method where the JVM starts executing the program. It is always present in every Java application.

3. **Variable Declarations and Initializations:**
   - `int intTwo = 5 ;`: Declares an integer variable named `intTwo` and initializes it with the value `5`.
   - `double kilometers = ( 100 * 1.609344 ) ;`: Declares a double variable named `kilometers`, calculates the distance equivalent in kilometers for 100 miles, and assigns the result to the variable.

4. **Print Statement:** `System.out.println("Expression : kilometers = ( 100 * 1.609344 ) = " +kilometers);` prints the expression and its result to the console.

5. **If Statement:** Checks if `highScore` equals `50`. If true, it prints the expression and the value of `highScore`.

6. **Another Variable Declaration and Initialization:** `int score = 100 ;` declares another integer variable named `score` and initializes it with the value `100`.

7. **Nested If Statement:** Checks if `score` is greater than `99`. If true, it prints a message, sets `score` to `0`, and then prints the expressions and their results.

#### Comments as Questions and Answers

1. **What is a keyword?**
   - A keyword is a reserved word in Java that cannot be used as identifiers such as variable names, class names, etc. They have predefined meanings and are part of the syntax of the language.

2. **Can you give examples of keywords?**
   - Yes, there are many keywords in Java, including `class`, `public`, `static`, `void`, `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `do`, `switch`, `case`, `break`, `continue`, `return`, `new`, `this`, `super`, `extends`, `implements`, `import`, `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`, `instanceof`, `enum`, `interface`, `default`, `abstract`, `final`, `transient`, `native`, `strictfp`, `assert`, `synchronized`, `volatile`, `const`, `goto`, `package`, `yield`, `var`, `lambda`, and more.

#### Dry Run

1. **Initialization:**
   - `intTwo` is initialized with `5`.
   - `kilometers` is calculated as `(100 * 1.609344)`, resulting in approximately `160.9344`.

2. **Execution Flow:**
   - The program prints the expression and result of converting miles to kilometers.
   - It checks if `highScore` equals `50`; since it does, it prints the expression and the value of `highScore`.
   - It then checks if `score` is greater than `99`; since it is, it prints a message, resets `score` to `0`, and prints the expressions and their results.

#### Additional Context

This code snippet demonstrates basic concepts in Java such as variable declaration, initialization, arithmetic operations, conditional statements (`if`), and printing to the console. It also introduces the concept of data types (`int`, `double`) and how to perform calculations involving these types. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for beginners learning Java.
