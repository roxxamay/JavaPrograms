### Code Explanation

```java
public class IfAndCodeblock {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean gameOver = true;
        int score = 1500;
        int levelCompleted = 5;
        int bonus = 100;

        if (score == 5000) {
            System.out.println("your score was 5000");
        }
        if (score < 5000 && score > 1000) {
            System.out.println("your score less than 5000 but greater than 1000");
        } else if (score < 1000) {
            System.out.println("your score was less than 1000");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("got here");
        }

        //another example

        if (gameOver) {
            int finalScore = score + (levelCompleted * bonus);
            System.out.println("your final score was : " + finalScore);
        }
        // System.out.println(finalScore);

        score = 10000;
        levelCompleted = 8;
        bonus = 200;

        System.out.println("score : " + score);
        System.out.println("levelcompleted : " + levelCompleted);
        System.out.println("bonus : " + bonus);

        if (gameOver) {
            int secondFinalScore = score + (levelCompleted * bonus);
            System.out.println("your second final score was : " + secondFinalScore);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

#### Keywords and Concepts

- **class**: A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
- **public**: An access modifier that makes this class accessible everywhere.
- **static**: A keyword indicating that the method belongs to the `IfAndCodeblock` class itself rather than to instances of the class.
- **void**: Indicates that the method does not return a value.
- **boolean**: A primitive data type that can hold one of two possible values: `true` or `false`.
- **int**: A primitive data type that holds integer values.
- **if**, **else if**, **else**: Conditional statements used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
- **System.out.println()**: A statement used to print text to the console.
- **{** and **}**: Used to define the scope of classes, methods, and blocks.

#### Comments as Questions

- **Q:** What does the `if` statement do?
  **A:** The `if` statement checks a condition and executes a block of code only if the condition evaluates to `true`.

- **Q:** How does the `else if` work?
  **A:** The `else if` statement allows for checking multiple conditions sequentially. It will execute its block of code only if the previous `if` and `else if` conditions were `false`, and its condition evaluates to `true`.

- **Q:** Why is there no semicolon after the `else` without a corresponding `if`?
  **A:** In Java, `else` must always be paired with an `if`. The semicolon indicates the end of the `else` statement, which is necessary because it doesn't have a corresponding `if` statement directly above it.

#### Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **Class Declaration**: Defines a new class named `IfAndCodeblock`.
2. **Main Method**: The entry point for any Java application.
3. **Variable Declarations**: Declares several variables (`gameOver`, `score`, `levelCompleted`, `bonus`) and initializes them with specific values.
4. **First Condition Check**: Checks if `score` equals 5000. If so, prints a message.
5. **Second Condition Check**: Checks if `score` is between 1000 and 5000. If so, prints a message.
6. **Third Condition Check**: Checks if `score` is less than 1000. If so, prints a message.
7. **Else Block**: Executes if none of the above conditions are met.
8. **Another Example Comment**: Indicates a separate example within the same method.
9. **Game Over Check**: Checks if the game is over. If so, calculates and prints the final score.
10. **Commented Out Print Statement**: A line that was likely intended to print the final score but is commented out.
11. **Updating Variables**: Updates the values of `score`, `levelCompleted`, and `bonus`.
12. **Printing Updated Values**: Prints the updated values of `score`, `levelCompleted`, and `bonus`.
13. **Second Game Over Check**: Similar to the first check, calculates and prints the second final score if the game is still considered over.

#### Dry Run

Given the initial values:
- `gameOver = true`
- `score = 1500`
- `levelCompleted = 5`
- `bonus = 100`

1. The program checks if `score` is 5000. Since it's not, it moves to the next condition.
2. Then, it checks if `score` is between 1000 and 5000. This condition is also false, so it moves to the next condition.
3. Finally, since `score` is not less than 1000, it enters the `else` block and prints "got here".
4. The program then updates the values of `score`, `levelCompleted`, and `bonus` and prints these updated values.
5. Since `gameOver` is still `true`, it recalculates the final score with the new values and prints it.

This dry run demonstrates how conditional statements and variable updates interact within a simple Java program.
