### Code Explanation

#### Code Snippet

```java
public class DayOfWeek {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printDayOfWeek(5);
        printDayOfWeek(15);
        printDayOfWeek(2);
        printDayOfWeek(6);
        printDayOfWeek(0);
        printDayOfWeek(-5);
    }

    public static void printDayOfWeek(int day) {
        switch (day) {
            case 0:
                System.out.println("it is Sunday");
                break;
            case 1:
                System.out.println("it is Monday");
                break;
            case 2:
                System.out.println("it is Tuesday");
                break;
            case 3:
                System.out.println("it is Wednesday");
                break;
            case 4:
                System.out.println("it is Thursday");
                break;
            case 5:
                System.out.println("it is Friday");
                break;
            case 6:
                System.out.println("it is Saturday");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Invalid day");
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation

1. **`public class DayOfWeek {`**

   -  `public`: Access modifier indicating that this class can be accessed from anywhere.
   -  `class`: Keyword used to declare a class in Java.
   -  `DayOfWeek`: Name of the class. By convention, class names start with an uppercase letter.

2. **`public static void main(String[] args) {`**

   -  `public`: Access modifier for the `main` method, allowing it to be called from anywhere.
   -  `static`: Indicates that the `main` method belongs to the `DayOfWeek` class itself rather than to instances of the class.
   -  `void`: Specifies that the `main` method does not return any value.
   -  `main`: Entry point for the Java application. When the program starts, the JVM calls the `main` method.
   -  `(String[] args)`: Parameter to the `main` method representing command-line arguments passed to the program.

3. **Method Calls Inside `main`**

   -  The `main` method calls `printDayOfWeek` with different integer arguments. These calls demonstrate how to use the `printDayOfWeek` method to print the day of the week corresponding to the given number.

4. **`public static void printDayOfWeek(int day) {`**

   -  Another `public` method declaration, accessible from anywhere.
   -  `static`: Like the `main` method, this method also belongs to the class rather than instances of the class.
   -  `void`: Indicates that this method does not return any value.
   -  `printDayOfWeek`: Method name.
   -  `(int day)`: Parameter to the method, representing the day of the week as an integer.

5. **Switch Statement**

   -  A `switch` statement is used to select one of many code blocks to execute based on the value of the `day` variable.

6. **Case Blocks**

   -  Each `case` block corresponds to a specific day of the week, represented by an integer. When the `day` parameter matches a `case`, the corresponding block of code executes, printing the day of the week.

7. **Default Block**

   -  The `default` block executes when none of the `case` conditions match the `day` parameter. In this case, it prints "Invalid day".

8. **Break Statements**
   -  After executing the code within a `case` block, the `break` statement exits the `switch` statement, preventing fall-through to subsequent cases.

#### Comments as Questions and Answers

-  **Q:** What does the `public` keyword do?

   -  **A:** The `public` keyword is an access modifier that allows a class, method, or field to be visible and accessible from any other class in the application.

-  **Q:** How does the `switch` statement work?

   -  **A:** The `switch` statement evaluates an expression and executes the block of code corresponding to the matching `case`. If no `case` matches, the `default` block is executed.

-  **Q:** Why is the `main` method `static`?

   -  **A:** The `main` method must be `static` because it needs to be called without creating an instance of the class. It serves as the entry point for the application.

-  **Q:** What happens if none of the `case` labels match the `day` parameter in the `switch` statement?
   -  **A:** If none of the `case` labels match, the `default` block is executed.

#### Dry Run

Given the inputs in the `main` method:

-  `printDayOfWeek(5);` -> Prints "it is Friday"
-  `printDayOfWeek(15);` -> Prints "Invalid day"
-  `printDayOfWeek(2);` -> Prints "it is Tuesday"
-  `printDayOfWeek(6);` -> Prints "it is Saturday"
-  `printDayOfWeek(0);` -> Prints "it is Sunday"
-  `printDayOfWeek(-5);` -> Prints "Invalid day"

#### Additional Context

This Java program demonstrates the use of the `switch` statement to map integers to days of the week. It's a simple example of decision-making in Java, where the program decides what to do based on the input it receives.
