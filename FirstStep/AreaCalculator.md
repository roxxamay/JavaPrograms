```java
/**
 * Question: Implementing Area Calculation with Method Overloading
 * Objective:
 * Design and implement a Java class named AreaCalculator that calculates areas for various shapes. Your implementation should utilize method overloading to handle different types of shapes (e.g., circle, rectangle, triangle). Each shape will have its own area calculation logic within overloaded methods.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * Class Design: Create a class named AreaCalculator.
 * Method Overloading: Implement overloaded methods for calculating the area of different shapes. At least three shapes must be included (circle, rectangle, and triangle).
 * A method for calculating the area of a circle, taking the radius as a parameter.
 * A method for calculating the area of a rectangle, taking length and width as parameters.
 * A method for calculating the area of a triangle, taking the base and height as parameters.
 * Shape Parameters: Ensure that each method signature is unique and correctly reflects the shape it calculates the area for.
 * Output: Each method should return the calculated area as a double value.
 * Example Usage: Provide example usage of your AreaCalculator class in the form of a main method or separate test cases to demonstrate how to calculate the area of each shape.
 * Notes:
 * Consider edge cases such as negative values for dimensions. Handle these appropriately within your methods.
 * Use descriptive variable names and ensure your code is clean and well-commented.
 * Submission Guidelines:
 * Submit your Java source code file (AreaCalculator.java) containing the implementation of the AreaCalculator class along with any additional comments explaining your design choices or challenging aspects of the problem.

#### Explanation

1. **Class Declaration (`public class AreaCalculator`)**: This line declares a public class named `AreaCalculator`. In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (methods).

2. **Method Overloading**: The class contains three overloaded methods named `calcArea`, each designed to calculate the area of different geometric shapes. Overloading allows multiple methods to have the same name but different parameters.

3. **Main Method (`public static void main(String[] args)`)**: The entry point for any Java application. When the program starts, the JVM calls the main method.

4. **Method Signature**: Each `calcArea` method has a unique signature based on the number and type of parameters it accepts. This uniqueness is crucial for method overloading resolution.

5. **Conditional Statements (`if`)**: Used to check for invalid input values (negative dimensions). If an invalid value is detected, the method prints an error message and returns `-1`.

6. **Arithmetic Operations**: The methods perform arithmetic operations to calculate the area of the shapes. For example, the area of a rectangle is calculated as `length * breadth`, and the area of a circle is calculated as `3.14 * radius * radius`.

7. **Type Casting (`(long)`)**: The result of the area calculations is cast to `long` to truncate decimal points. However, this might not always be appropriate, especially for floating-point results where precision could be significant.

8. **System.out.println**: Used to print messages to the console, including the calculated area and error messages.

9. **Return Statement**: Each method returns the calculated area as a `long` value. For invalid inputs, it returns `-1`.

#### Dry Run

Let's simulate the execution of the `main` method:

-  **First Call (`calcArea(31563);`)**: Calls the `calcArea` method with one argument, treating it as a circle's radius. Since the radius is positive, it calculates and prints the area of the circle, then returns the area.

-  **Second Call (`calcArea(23151, 5233);`)**: Calls the `calcArea` method with two arguments, treating them as the length and width of a rectangle. It checks for negative values, finds none, calculates the area, prints it, and returns the area.

-  **Third Call (`calcArea(351, 241, 352);`)**: Calls the `calcArea` method with three arguments, treating them as sides of a triangle. It checks for negative values, finds none, calculates the area using Heron's formula, prints it, and returns the area.

#### Additional Context

-  **Method Overloading Resolution**: Java resolves method overloads based on the number and type of arguments passed. It matches the call to the first method that exactly fits the argument list.

-  **Error Handling**: The use of conditional statements to check for invalid inputs (like negative dimensions) demonstrates basic error handling in Java.

-  **Comments as Questions**: The comments at the beginning serve as instructions or requirements for the implementation. They guide the developer on what needs to be done and why certain decisions were made.

This explanation covers the key components and concepts used in the `AreaCalculator` class, providing insights into method overloading, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and basic error handling in Java.
