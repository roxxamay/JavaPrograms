### Explanation of Each Keyword and Concept Used

- **public**: This keyword defines the accessibility of the class. A `public` class can be accessed from any other class.
- **class**: This keyword is used to declare a class in Java. Classes are blueprints for creating objects.
- **Var**: This is the name of the class. Class names typically start with an uppercase letter.
- **{** and **}**: These curly braces enclose the body of the class, which contains all the fields (variables) and methods (functions) of the class.
- **public static void main(String[] args)**: This is the method where the program starts executing. It must be present in every Java application.
    - **public**: The method can be accessed from any other class.
    - **static**: The method belongs to the `Var` class itself, not to any instance of the class.
    - **void**: The method does not return any value.
    - **main**: The entry point for the Java application. The JVM calls this method when the program starts.
    - **String[] args**: An array of strings that can be used to pass command-line arguments to the program.

### Line-by-Line Explanation

```java
1: public class Var {
```
- Declares a public class named `Var`.

```java
2:     public static void main(String[] args) {
```
- Defines the `main` method within the `Var` class. This method is the entry point of the program.

```java
3:         //init myFirstNumber
4:         int myFirstNumber = 5;
```
- Initializes an integer variable named `myFirstNumber` with the value `5`.

```java
5:         //printing the value
6:         System.out.println("myFirstNumber is " + myFirstNumber);
```
- Prints the value of `myFirstNumber` to the console.

```java
7: 
8:         //sum
9:         int mySum = (10 + 5) + (2 * 10);
```
- Calculates the sum of several expressions and assigns the result to an integer variable named `mySum`.
    - `(10 + 5)` adds `10` and `5`, resulting in `15`.
    - `(2 * 10)` multiplies `2` by `10`, resulting in `20`.
    - The entire expression `(10 + 5) + (2 * 10)` results in `35`.

```java
10:         //printing the sum
11:         System.out.println("mySum is " + mySum);
```
- Prints the value of `mySum` to the console.

```java
12:     }
```
- Closes the `main` method block.

```java
13: }
```
- Closes the `Var` class definition.

### Dry Run

1. **Start**: The JVM starts and loads the `Var` class.
2. **Load `main` Method**: The JVM locates the `main` method within the `Var` class.
3. **Execute `main` Method**:
    - `myFirstNumber` is initialized with `5`.
    - The first `println` statement prints `"myFirstNumber is 5"` to the console.
    - `mySum` is calculated as `35`.
    - The second `println` statement prints `"mySum is 35"` to the console.
4. **End**: The program terminates after the `main` method completes execution.

### Additional Context

This code demonstrates basic Java syntax and operations, including variable initialization, arithmetic operations, and output to the console. It's a foundational example that helps beginners understand how to write and execute simple Java programs.
