Let's analyze the provided Java code from `Var.java`:

```java
public class Var {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //init myFirstNumber
        int myFirstNumber = 5;
        //printing the value
        System.out.println("myFirstNumber is " + myFirstNumber);

        //sum
        int mySum = (10 + 5) + (2 * 10);
        //printing the sum
        System.out.println("mySum is " + mySum);
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Keywords and Concepts Used

- **public**: This is an access modifier that specifies the class is accessible everywhere.
- **class**: A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (methods).
- **Var**: The name of the class.
- **{**: Marks the beginning of the class body.
- **}**: Marks the end of the class body.
- **public static void main(String[] args)**: The entry point for any Java application. When the JVM starts, it calls the main method.
  - **public**: Access modifier for the main method, making it accessible everywhere.
  - **static**: Indicates that the method belongs to the `Var` class itself, not to any instance of the class.
  - **void**: Specifies that the main method doesn't return any value.
  - **main**: The name of the method.
  - **String[] args**: An array of strings passed as arguments to the program when it's started from the command line.
- **int**: A primitive data type that represents integer values.
- **myFirstNumber**: A variable of type `int`.
- **=**: Assignment operator used to assign the value on its right to the variable on its left.
- **System.out.println()**: A statement used to print text to the standard output stream (usually the console).

### Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **public class Var {**: Declares a public class named `Var`.
2. **public static void main(String[] args) {**: Defines the `main` method, which is the entry point for the Java application.
3. **int myFirstNumber = 5;**: Initializes an integer variable `myFirstNumber` with the value `5`.
4. **System.out.println("myFirstNumber is " + myFirstNumber);**: Prints the string `"myFirstNumber is "` followed by the value of `myFirstNumber` to the console.
5. **int mySum = (10 + 5) + (2 * 10);**: Performs arithmetic operations and assigns the result to the integer variable `mySum`.
6. **System.out.println("mySum is " + mySum);**: Prints the string `"mySum is "` followed by the value of `mySum` to the console.

### Dry Run

- **Initialization**: At the start, `myFirstNumber` is initialized with `5`, and `mySum` is calculated as `(10 + 5) + (2 * 10)` which equals `25`.
- **Output 1**: The first `println` statement outputs: `myFirstNumber is 5`.
- **Calculation**: No operation is performed between the two calculations, so `mySum` remains `25`.
- **Output 2**: The second `println` statement outputs: `mySum is 25`.

### Additional Context
