```java
public class CharAndBoolean {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //answer these questions
        //difference between char and string
        //define char and its size
        //define Unicode and its size , representation
        //define boolean and its size
        
        char myChar = 'D';
        char myUnicodeChar = '\u0044';
        
        System.out.println("char myChar = 'D'  : " + myChar);
        System.out.println("char myUnicodeChar = '\u0044' : " + myUnicodeChar);
        
        //copyright char
        char myCopyrightChar = '\u00A9';
        System.out.println("char myCopyrightChar = '\u00A9' : " + myCopyrightChar);
        
        boolean myTrueBooleanValue = true;
        boolean myFalseBooleanValue = false;
        
        boolean isCustomerOverTwentyOne = true;
        
        //printing bool
        System.out.println("boolean myTrueBooleanValue = true : " + myTrueBooleanValue);
        System.out.println("boolean myFalseBooleanValue = false : " + myFalseBooleanValue);
        System.out.println("boolean isCustomerOverTwentyOne = true : " + isCustomerOverTwentyOne);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

#### Keywords and Concepts

- **public**: Access modifier indicating the class `CharAndBoolean` is accessible everywhere.
- **class**: Keyword used to declare a class named `CharAndBoolean`.
- **{ }**: Braces denote the beginning and end of a block of code, such as a class body or a method body.
- **static**: Modifier applied to methods, meaning it belongs to the class itself rather than instances of the class.
- **void**: Indicates that a method does not return any value.
- **main**: Special method where the program starts execution.
- **String[] args**: Parameter array containing command-line arguments passed to the program.
- **char**: Primitive type representing a single character.
- **boolean**: Primitive type representing a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

#### Comments as Questions and Answers

1. **Difference between char and String**
   - Answer: `char` is a primitive data type that holds a single character, while `String` is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.

2. **Define char and its size**
   - Answer: `char` is a primitive data type that stores a single 16-bit Unicode character.

3. **Define Unicode and its size, representation**
   - Answer: Unicode is a standard encoding system that assigns a unique number to every character across multiple platforms and languages. It uses 16 bits for each character, allowing for 65,536 possible characters.

4. **Define boolean and its size**
   - Answer: `boolean` is a primitive data type that can hold one of two values: `true` or `false`. It uses 1 bit of memory.

#### Line-by-Line Explanation

- Lines 2-28 define the `main` method, the entry point of the Java application.
- Lines 9-11 initialize `myChar` with the character `'D'` and `myUnicodeChar` with the Unicode character `\u0044`, both representing the same character but demonstrating how characters can be represented in Java.
- Lines 12-14 print the values of `myChar` and `myUnicodeChar`.
- Line 16 initializes `myCopyrightChar` with the copyright symbol `Â©`, demonstrating the use of Unicode for special characters.
- Lines 17 prints the value of `myCopyrightChar`.
- Lines 19-21 initialize three boolean variables: `myTrueBooleanValue`, `myFalseBooleanValue`, and `isCustomerOverTwentyOne`, with `true` and `false` values.
- Lines 25-27 print the values of the boolean variables.

#### Dry Run

1. The program starts execution at the `main` method.
2. Variables `myChar`, `myUnicodeChar`, `myCopyrightChar`, `myTrueBooleanValue`, `myFalseBooleanValue`, and `isCustomerOverTwentyOne` are initialized.
3. The program prints the values of `myChar`, `myUnicodeChar`, and `myCopyrightChar`.
4. The program prints the values of `myTrueBooleanValue`, `myFalseBooleanValue`, and `isCustomerOverTwentyOne`.

#### Additional Context

This code demonstrates the basics of handling characters and booleans in Java, including the use of Unicode for special characters and printing values to the console. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for beginners learning Java, as they form the basis for more complex data manipulations and logic operations later on.
