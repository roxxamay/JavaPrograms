### Code Explanation

#### Code Before Explanation

```java
/**
 * Write a method printYearsAndDays with parameter of type long named minutes.
 * 
 * The method should not return anything (void) and it needs to calculate the years and days from the minutes parameter.
 * 
 * If the parameter is less than 0, print text "Invalid Value".
 * 
 * Otherwise, if the parameter is valid then it needs to print a message in the format "XX min = YY y and ZZ d".
 * 
 * XX represents the original value minutes.
 * YY represents the calculated years.
 * ZZ represents the calculated days.
 * 
 * 
 * EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:
 * 
 * * printYearsAndDays(525600);  → should print "525600 min = 1 y and 0 d"
 * 
 * * printYearsAndDays(1051200); → should print "1051200 min = 2 y and 0 d"
 * 
 * * printYearsAndDays(561600);  → should print "561600 min = 1 y and 25 d"
 * 
 * 
 * TIPS:
 * 
 * * Be extra careful about spaces in the printed message.
 * 
 * * Use the remainder operator
 * 
 * * 1 hour = 60 minutes
 * 
 * * 1 day = 24 hours
 * 
 * * 1 year = 365 days
 * 
 * NOTES
 * 
 * * The printYearsAndDays method needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
 * 
 * * Do not add main method to solution code.
 * 
 * * The solution will not be accepted if there are extra spaces
 *  */

#### Explanation

1. **Class Declaration (`public class MinutesToYearsAndDaysCalculator`)**: Defines a public class named `MinutesToYearsAndDaysCalculator`. In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (methods).

2. **Method Declaration (`public static void main(String[] args)`)**: The `main` method is the entry point for any Java application. It must always be present in every Java program. The `public` keyword means the method is accessible everywhere. `static` means the method belongs to the `MinutesToYearsAndDaysCalculator` class itself, rather than to instances of the class. `void` indicates that the method doesn't return any value. `String[] args` defines an array of strings that can be passed as arguments when the program is executed.

3. **Method Invocation (`calcMinToYearsAndDays(5465464);`)**: Calls the `calcMinToYearsAndDays` method with an argument of `5465464`.

4. **Method Declaration (`public static void calcMinToYearsAndDays(double minutes)`)**: Declares another method within the same class. This method is also `public`, `static`, and `void`. It takes one parameter, `double minutes`, which represents the total number of minutes to convert into years and days.

5. **Conditional Statement (`if (minutes < 0)`)**: Checks if the input `minutes` is less than zero. If true, it prints "Invalid Number".

6. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - **Division and Casting (`long year =(long) minutes / 525600;`)**: Divides the total minutes by 525600 (the approximate number of minutes in a year) and casts the result to `long` to remove the decimal part. This gives the number of full years.
   - **Subtraction (`long minutesReamining = (long) (minutes - (year * 525600));`)**: Calculates the remaining minutes after subtracting the full years multiplied by 525600.
   - **Division and Casting (`long daysReamining = (long) (minutesReamining / 1440);`)**: Divides the remaining minutes by 1440 (the number of minutes in a day) to find the number of full days.
   - **Modulus Operation (`minutesReamining = (long) (minutesReamining % 1440);`)**: Finds the remaining minutes after removing the full days.

7. **Print Statement (`System.out.println(minutes + " : " + year + "yrs " + daysReamining + "days" + minutesReamining + "minutes");`)**: Prints the total minutes, calculated years, days, and remaining minutes in the specified format.

#### Dry Run

Let's perform a dry run of the code with the input `5465464` minutes.

1. **Input**: `5465464` minutes.
2. **Check if negative**: Not negative, proceed.
3. **Calculate years**: `5465464 / 525600 = 10` years.
4. **Calculate remaining minutes**: `5465464 - (10 * 525600) = 66064`.
5. **Calculate days**: `66064 / 1440 = 45` days.
6. **Calculate remaining minutes**: `66064 % 1440 = 664` minutes.
7. **Output**: `5465464 : 10yrs 45days 664minutes`.

#### Additional Context

- The code calculates the equivalent years and days from a given number of minutes.
- It uses arithmetic operations (division, subtraction, modulus) to achieve this conversion.
- The division by 525600 converts minutes to years because there are approximately 525600 minutes in a year.
- The division by 1440 converts remaining minutes to days because there are 1440 minutes in a day.
- The modulus operation finds the remaining minutes after converting to days.
- The code is designed to handle non-negative inputs only, printing "Invalid Number" for negative inputs.
