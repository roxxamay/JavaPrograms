Let's analyze the provided Java code from `Expression.java`:

```java
public class Expression {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //int numbers
        int myFirstNumber = (10 + 5) + (2 * 10);
        int mySecondNumber = 12;
        int myThirdNumber = 23;

        //totaling
        int myTotal = myFirstNumber + mySecondNumber + myThirdNumber;

        System.out.println("myTotal is : " + myTotal);

        //challenge
        //100 less than myTotal
        int myLastOne = 100 - myTotal;
        //printing myLast
        System.out.println("myLastOne : " + myLastOne);
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Keywords and Concepts Used

- **public**: Access modifier indicating the class is accessible everywhere.
- **class**: Keyword used to declare a class.
- **Expression**: The name of the class.
- **{**: Marks the beginning of the class body.
- **}**: Marks the end of the class body.
- **public static void main(String[] args)**: The entry point for any Java application. When the JVM starts, it calls the main method.
  - **public**: Access modifier for the main method, making it accessible everywhere.
  - **static**: Indicates that the method belongs to the `Expression` class itself, not to any instance of the class.
  - **void**: Specifies that the main method doesn't return any value.
  - **main**: The name of the method.
  - **String[] args**: An array of strings passed as arguments to the program when it's started from the command line.
- **int**: A primitive data type representing integer values.
- **System.out.println()**: A statement used to print text to the standard output stream (usually the console).

### Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **public class Expression {**: Declares a public class named `Expression`.
2. **public static void main(String[] args) {**: Defines the `main` method, which is the entry point for the Java application.
3. **int myFirstNumber = (10 + 5) + (2 * 10);**: Initializes an integer variable `myFirstNumber` with the result of the arithmetic expression `(10 + 5) + (2 * 10)`, which equals `35`.
4. **int mySecondNumber = 12;**: Initializes an integer variable `mySecondNumber` with the value `12`.
5. **int myThirdNumber = 23;**: Initializes an integer variable `myThirdNumber` with the value `23`.
6. **int myTotal = myFirstNumber + mySecondNumber + myThirdNumber;**: Calculates the total by adding `myFirstNumber`, `mySecondNumber`, and `myThirdNumber`, and assigns the result to `myTotal`. Given the previous initialization, `myTotal` becomes `70`.
7. **System.out.println("myTotal is : " + myTotal);**: Prints the string `"myTotal is :"` followed by the value of `myTotal` (`70`) to the console.
8. **int myLastOne = 100 - myTotal;**: Calculates the difference between `100` and `myTotal` (`70`), and assigns the result to `myLastOne`. Therefore, `myLastOne` becomes `30`.
9. **System.out.println("myLastOne : " + myLastOne);**: Prints the string `"myLastOne :"` followed by the value of `myLastOne` (`30`) to the console.

### Dry Run

- **Initialization**: Variables `myFirstNumber`, `mySecondNumber`, and `myThirdNumber` are initialized with specific values.
- **Calculation**: `myTotal` is calculated by adding all three numbers, resulting in `70`.
- **Output 1**: The first `println` statement outputs: `myTotal is : 70`.
- **Challenge Calculation**: `myLastOne` is calculated by subtracting `myTotal` from `100`, resulting in `30`.
- **Output 2**: The second `println` statement outputs: `myLastOne : 30`.

### Additional Context

This code snippet demonstrates basic arithmetic operations, variable initialization, and output formatting in Java. It also introduces the concept of performing calculations based on previously defined variables. Understanding how to manipulate and use variables effectively is crucial for solving problems and developing logic in programming.
