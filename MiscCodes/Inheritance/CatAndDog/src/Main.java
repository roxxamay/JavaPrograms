//Hierarchical Inheritance Example
//When two or more classes inherits a single class,
// it is known as hierarchical inheritance.
// In the example given below, Dog and Cat classes inherits
// the Animal class, so there is hierarchical inheritance.


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cat c = new Cat() ;
        c.meow();
        c.eat();
        
    }
}
